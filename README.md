# josh_password_generator_JS

## A password generator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- I wanted a way to generate complex passwords using multiple types, randomly.
- I built this as a way to randomly generate secure passwords and improve security.
- I took bias and predictability out of password generation.
- I learned how to randomly generate combinations of characters but also how to use user input to cultivate the final product.

## Usage

Open the webpage and answer the prompts as they appear. The program should force you to answer properly. Once you've acquired your code you may press the button again to generate a new password.
